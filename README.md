# Hi 👋

I'm a student from Croatia 🇭🇷, who loves open source, and is currently working as system engineer at CROZ. I'm studying Information and Data Science at The Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Computer Science and Information Technology Osijek 🏫.

My current plan is to explore DevOps and Machine Learning, and after aquiring needed skills enter the world of MLOps and AIOps. 💻
